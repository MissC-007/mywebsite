					<h2>Molton Barn, Jackson Hole, Wyoming</h2>
					<p>Jackson Hole in Wyoming is an area of amazing mountains, wildlife and scenery. </p>
					<p>The Grand Tetons are huge, spikey, snow-capped mountains that look exactly like something a child would draw. They are fantastic as a backdrop and are also happy to be the centre of attention. They capture the sunrise and sunset light well, and are always showing their best side. </p>
					<p>I became notorious for lying on the ground to get a shot, trying to emmulate professional photographs I had seen with flowers in the foreground and mountains or other scenery in the background. It turns out that you need to lie on the ground to get it. So I did.</p>
					<p class="newLine">The highlight was the inspiration and information from the other photographers in the group. We had everything from absolute beginners with small instant cameras, to fully kitted professional photographers with gear that cost more than a car. And every single person was there to learn and share.</p>

						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>An early morning was all it took to get this almost perfect reflection of the mountains. The location itself is known as being a bit of a photographic show-off, but when you look this good, I think you can get away with being a bit of a poser.</p>

						<p>I'd always thought it was just imagination whenever I heard someone describe storm clouds as an anvil, but it turns out they really can look like one.</p>

						<h2>Molton Barn, Jackson Hole, Wyoming</h2>
						<p>Molton Barn is an icon of Jackson Hole in Wyoming, and this is my attempt to replicate other photographers images. The hardest part was getting the light just right. Sunrise is fickle and completely out of our control.</p>
						<p>This was taken on the very last morning, almost as an afterthought.</p>

						<h2>Bell and Chain</h2>
						<p>A simple church bell and chain.</p>
						<p>It's nothing particularly special but the chain has a nice regularity to it.</p>

						<h2>Flower and Mountain</h2>
						<p>I became known in the group for lying on the ground to get a shot. In this case I think it paid off.</p>
						<p>Snow-capped mountains take the back-seat to the gorgeous yellow flowers and the clouds.</p>

						<p>An early morning gave us the tail of an overnight storm.</p>
						<p>These lovely clouds add a little something to the silhouette of the trees.</p>
