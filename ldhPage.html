					<h2>Mt Lidgebird &amp; Mt Gower,<br>Lord Howe Island.</h2>
					<p>Lord Howe Island is a hidden gem.</p>
					<p>As an absolute beginner, I took part in my very first Walking &amp; Photography Week in July 2012, a trip was exactly what it said it was - we walked &amp; took photos.</p>
					<p class="newLine">The plan for the day would be outlined at breakfast, the route would depend on the weather conditions, and that days 'brief' announced. Each day was a different brief and a very different challenge. </p>
					<p>We would then head out as a group, taking our time or rushing as the mood and situation required. It was a mixed group of participants, mostly older, most with pocket cameras, but all enthusiastic and eager to enjoy themselves.</p>
					<p>We were out in rain and sunshine, cold and warm. It was definitely worth tolerating the cold and wet weather for the rainbows and fantastic storm clouds. </p>
					<p class="newLine">I think Lord Howe Island shows itself at its best in terrible weather. It's lovely in Summer, but absolutely gorgeous in Winter.</p>

						<h2>A Snail</h2>
						<p>This little guy was just minding his own business, doing whatever it is that snails do. His trail in the sand looked interesting, leading out of the water.</p>
						<p>I submitted this picture for the daily 'photo competition', the theme of which was 'drama'.</p>
						<p>He won me my very first photo prize - a bottle of wine, which was shared at dinner that night. </p>

						<h2>My Feet</h2>
						<p>Me being a bit silly. I've discovered that I really like taking photos of my feet when I go travelling, especially if they can be from a place a little bit out of the way.</p>
						<p>This one was taken at Blinky Beach, after rising very early in the morning to photograph the sunrise - another habit while on holidays.</p>
						<p>It's become something of a habit when I go to Lord Howe Island, something that I did on my very first trip and on every trip to the island ever since.</p>

						<h2>Storm Clouds</h2>
						<p>While out on one of the daily photo-tour hikes, these amazing storm clouds rolled in over The Lagoon, so we took some photos before carrying on. </p>
						<p>The storm stayed for most of the day.</p>
						<p>Normally that would be disappointing while on holiday, a whole day of rain and storms, but it gave us different light conditions to experiment with, and constantly changing cloud conditions.</p>

						<h2>Beached Tree Log</h2>
						<p>I love this log. </p>
						<p>On one side of it is clear, empty sand. On the other side there are rocks strewn all over the place.</p>
						<p>You can almost imagine a storm far out to sea, and the tree bobbing along until it reaches land.

						<h2>The Lagoon</h2>
						<p>My favourite - storm clouds.</p>
						<p>The additional height provided by the hill we'd climbed offers a beautiful view of the still blue water of The Lagoon with the multi-layered storm clouds up above.</p>
						<p>And then the rain came down.</p>

						<h2>A Slug</h2>
						<p>I'm not a particular fan of creepy crawlies, especially slimy ones, but this little guy is almost adorable, looking up at me like he is.</p>
						<p>He was walking (sliding?) along a timber step on the path when I spotted him and decided to try my hand at some macro.</p>
						<p>I think it worked well.</p>

						<p>Looking from the South of the island, near the golf course, up the length of The Lagoon.</p>
						<p>Mt Eliza is in the background, with Blackburn Island (also known as Goat or Rabbit Island) almost camouflaged in the shadows and haze inbetween.</p>

						<h2>Blinky Beach at sunrise</h2>
						<p>It is such a beautiful beach and such a beautiful time of day, I make sure I watch at least one sunrise every time I go to Lord Howe Island.</p>
						<p>Later in the day there could be a plane passing very low overhead - the airport is just on the other side of the ridge to the right.</p>

						<h2>View From The Goathouse</h2>
						<p>The Goathouse at Lord Howe Island offers a fantastic view of the island, from South to North.</p>
						<p>A couple of hours trek up some pretty steep trails, including a couple of sections with ropes to stop you from falling off completely, mean that by the time you get up there and catch your breath, you can really appreciate the extraordinary view.</p>
						<p>Take  plenty of water and a packed lunch to experience a really beautiful picnic spot.</p>
