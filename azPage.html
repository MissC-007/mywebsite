					<h2>Desert, Arizona</h2>
					<p>At the start, my 'must see' list for Arizona was actually quite short: <br>Cactus; Desert; Rain in the Desert <span>- tricky</span>; Frank Lloyd Wright's <span>Taliesin West</span>; Meteor Crater; Kitt Peak Observatory; Lowell Observatory; Grand Canyon; Monument Valley. </p>
					<p>The reason for the list's brevity was simple. <br> I wanted to explore, to see what was actually there, to stumble upon things, to go with the flow. </p>
					<p>There was a day that I could either go West or East. I could see storm clouds to the East so I went that way and followed the clouds. </p>
					<p>What a great decision. The storm was amazing and gave me the opportunity to photograph rain in the desert from my list. </p>
					<p class="newLine">Exploring South from Tucson, right along the Mexico border, I did get to witness the Border Patrol guys in action, with their guns drawn on a car full of possible illegal immigrants.</p>
					<p>Kitt Peak Observatory was another on my list, a mountain ridge dotted with white-domed telescopes of various sizes. I spent the entire day doing tours of the main telescopes and was even able to look at the sun through the specially designed sun telescope.</p>
					<p>A highlight that wasn't on my list was the Titan Missile Museum to the South of Tucson. An interesting and entertaining day of something I never thought I'd ever see.

						<h2>Fabulous Streaky Clouds</h2>
						<p>Driving about you see a lot of road and a lot of sky. </p>
						<p>Sounds pretty boring unless you like driving and like looking at the sky. </p>
						<p>Luckily I like both. Driving is pretty much the only time I sing out loud (incredibly badly) and I just can't get enough of the sky. Nature is amazing and I appreciate some of the weird results that can happen, like these streaky clouds.</p>
						<p>So, it always pays to look up, or behind you. You never know what you'll see.</p>

						<h2>Sunrise at the Grand Canyon</h2>
						<p>The Grand Canyon is so iconic, how could I possibly resist getting up early to photograph it at sunrise? I even managed to get a few of the other tour guests to join me.</p>
						<p>The cold, strong wind didn't stop the show though. Beautiful.</p>

						<h2>Saguaro Cactus</h2>
						<p>Standing tall, with raised 'arms', Sagurao Cactus have such character.</p>
						<p>They were flowering while I was travelling around, and sometimes the flowers looked like hair on a balding man, giving them even more personality.</p>

						<h2>Sunset at the Grand Canyon</h2>
						<p>After finding our rooms and getting our bearings, a few intrepid tour guests joined me on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon to watch (and photograph) the sun setting. </p>
						<p>The colours and shadows were so lovely to watch, even when the temperature dropped.</p>

						<h2>A Squirrel</h2>
						<p>Squirrels are pretty much everywhere in the US. This guy was one of the bravest, popping out from his hiding spot to check out what I was doing.</p>
						<p>It was a good thing I turned around to grab a different lens, because I wouldn't have seen him otherwise.</p>

						<h2>Stretching Hummingbird</h2>
						<p>Ahh... Hummingbirds.</p>
						<p>A stinking hot day, wandering around a 'cactus museum' in Tucson, and I found the Hummingbird enclosure. It seemed empty, but it was cool so I sat for a minute to enjoy the shade. </p>
						<p>Then a blur whizzed passed my head. And another. Too fast to follow. </p>
						<p>It turns out there were hundreds of Hummingbirds in there, but they are so tiny and so quick they are very easy to miss. I ended up staying in there for an hour and got some great shots. And it was cool...</p>

						<h2>Petrified Tree</h2>
						<p>I heard about the Petrified Forest while I was on an organised tour and decided to find it once the tour was finished. Luckily, it's not too far from the Meteor Crater, so I spent a couple of nights in Winslow AZ and saw both.</p>
						<p>The Petrified Forest is a huge place. It's not just one simple wooden path to walk around, it's lots of paths amongst spectacular scenery with a lot of driving in between. Definitely worth taking a whole day to explore.</p>
						<p>But this one reminds me of sausages...</p>

						<h2>Aliens Are Coming!</h2>
						<p>Not really, just a cloud. But what a cloud!.</p>
						<p>A pretty good day included a pretty awesome cloud formation.</p>
						<p>I've seen photos of clouds like these with descriptions along the lines of... "UFO sighted near Smalltown USA!". I'm impressed that I saw one in real life and even more impressed that I managed to photograph it.</p>
